I worked on this project in 2019, there are 6 python files that handel all the processing of the game data. To play games, you need to run the '''end proj.py''' file.

## Requirements:

You would require matplotlib and mysql libraries.
Moreover, you will need to have mysql installed and set up.


## Other edits before use:

Once you have an account on mysql, update your password in the '''SQL.py''' file.

## To install the requirements use the following:
'''
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install matplotlib
'''

#To install mySQl use the following link:
